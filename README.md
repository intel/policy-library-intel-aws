# Intel AWS RDS Database Sentinel Policies for Terraform

This library, provides prescriptive Terraform policies that can be used to establish a seemless and performant baseline Terraform configuration for Amazon Web Services RDS. The policies that are contained in this library are based on the [Open-Source Database Tuning Guide on 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors Based Platform](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/Open-Source-Database-Tuning-Guide-on-3rd-Generation-Intel-Xeon-Scalable-Processors.pdf). Terraform Cloud/Enterprise users can use the policies in this library to establish a foundational level of instance verification and enforcement for the database services that they are adopting in Amazon Web Services.
